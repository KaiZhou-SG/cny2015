JavaScript in HTML

>>> HEmbedding JavaScripts into HTML
1 Between script tags
  1.1 use the script tag, and put the codes in-between the tags
    <script type="text/javascript">
	  // codes go here
	</script>
2 External files
  2.1 use the script tag with src attribute:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="scriptName.js">
	  // the source code file scriptName.js is copied to this HTML page
	</script>
3 Inline in the HTML
  3.1 Normally the HTML event attributes are used to call functions specified
 elsewhere in script tags. In rare cases you may wish to add the javascript 
 code directly to these onClick or onMouseOver event tags, this is not 
 considered good design.
>>> Events
  Some html elements have event attributes, that can be used to call JavaScript
  functions when an event is triggered.
  There are many events available, and these three are most usual ones:
4 OnClick
  4.1 this attribute is executed when an element, such as a link or image, is 
 clicked on.
5 OnMouseOver
  5.1 this attribute is executed when a user moves the mouse onto and hovers 
 over an element.
6 OnMouseOut
  6.1 OnMouseOut is the opposite to OnMouseOver, and will be called when the 
 user's mouse is moved back off an element
