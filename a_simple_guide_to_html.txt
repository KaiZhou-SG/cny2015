>>> A simple guide to HTML
1 What is HTML
  1.1 HTML = Hyper-Text Mark-up Language, it's a language for describing 
 web-pages using ordinary text.
  1.2 HTML is NOT a complex language.
2 HTML files
  2.1 Every web page is actually a HTML file. Each HTML file is just a plain-
 text file, but with a .html file extension instead of .txt, and is made up of 
 many HTML tags as well as the content for a web page.
  2.2 A web site will often contain many html files that link to each other. 
 You can edit HTML files with your favourite editor.
3 HTML tags
  3.1 HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how the
 browser must format and display the content. 
  3.2 Most tags must have two parts: an opening and a closing part. Note that
 the closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional
 forward-slash(/) character. I tend to interpret this as the "end" or "close"
 character.
  3.3 Each HTML file must have the essential tags for it to be valid, so that
 web browsers can understand it and display it correctly. The rest of the HTML
 file can then contain as little or as many tags as you want to display your
 content.
4 Tag attributes
  4.1 Attributes allow you to customize a tag, and are defined within the 
 opening tag. 
  4.2 Most attributes are optional for most tags, and are only used when
 you want to change something about the default way a tag is displayed by
 the browser. However, some tags such as the <img> tag has required attributes
 such as src and alt which are needed in order for the browser to display the 
 web page properly.
  4.3 Attributes are often assigned a value using the equal sign, such as
 border="0" or width="50%", but there are some that only need to be declared
 in the tag like this: <hr noshade>
